## Overview

- This is a portfolio website built with React. It contains a short bio, a list of projects, and a contact form.

## The Challenge

### Design

The portfolio should look "polished" and "professional". Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a colour palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and the colours don't cause eye strain.

### Base Requirements

* Technologies that must be used:
  * [ ] React
  * [ ] Navigation with `React Router`, dynamic rendering, or another third-party router
* Your portfolio **must contain** the following information:
  * [ ] Your name
  * [ ] Links to your:
    * [ ] GitHub Profile
    * [ ] LinkedIn Page
    * [ ] Email Address
    * [ ] Phone Number - (optional)
    * [ ] PDF version of your resume
      * Your resume **must** contain up-to-date projects and professional experience
    * [ ] A list of projects (Challenges or Projects). For each project, make sure you have the following:
      * [ ] Project title
      * [ ] Link to the deployed version
      * [ ] Link to the GitHub repository
      * [ ] GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

### Required Components

* At a minimum, your portfolio must render these 6 components:
  1. [ ] App

  3. [ ] Home
  4. [ ] Project Gallery
  5. [ ] Project

* [ ] Header:
  * [ ] Must be rendered across the entire site
  * [ ] Must Contain a Navbar
* [ ] Project Gallery:
  * [ ] Must render dynamically 6 instances of the Project component
    * [ ] Be sure to store your project data in a JSON file and import it into your project
* [ ] Project:
  * [ ] Must be a reusable component that ingests JSON data as props and renders a single instance for each project.
  * [ ] Must utilize router props to render the right project based on user selection properly
  * [ ] Must render the following info:
    * [ ] Project title
    * [ ] Link to the deployed version
    * [ ] Link to the GitHub repository
    * [ ] GIF or screenshot of the deployed application
* [ ] Contact:
  * [ ] Must have contact information
  * [ ] Have a contact form for handling events
* [ ] Home:
  * This should be a welcome landing page that contains:
